# Types of Damage

Some notes:

* This only applies to non-Railjack combat. Railjack combat is an entirely different story.
* "x second independent duration" means that all stacks in a given debuff have independent durations.
* "x second refreshing duration" means that reapplying a given debuff resets the duration timer.
* "max x replacing stacks" means that if a given debuff has x stacks and another stack is applied, the new stack replaces the oldest stack.

## Basic Damage
### Damage
No additional effect. 
### Impact
**Grineer 1.5x, Kuva Grineer 1.5x**

Inflicts Stagger (max 5 replacing stacks, 6 second refreshing duration).

Crowd Controls enemies. Ospreys, Tenno and bosses are immune to Stagger.

Stagger increases the Parazon mercy kill threshold on heavy units by 8% of the target's max HP per stack, up to 80% max health.
### Pierce
**Corpus 1.5x, Orokin 1.5x**

Inflicts Weakened (max 5 replacing stacks, 6 second refreshing duration).

Reduces enemy damage output by 40% at one stack.

Further stacks decrease enemy damage output by 10% per stack, up to 80% reduced damage.
### Slash
**Infested 1.5x, Narmer 1.5x**

Inflicts Bleed (unlimited stacks, unlimited duration (not sure about this, the wiki doesn't say if it has a duration)).

Deals *Cinematic* damage every 6 seconds (first tick is delayed by 1 second). 

Each stack deals damage individually.

Cinematic damage bypasses all damage buffs/reductions.
## Elemental Damage
### Cold
**Sentient 1.5x**

Inflicts Freeze (max 10 replacing stacks, 6 second independent duration).

The first stack reduces target's movement speed, attack speed and firerate* by 50%. Additional stacks increase this effect by 5% per stack, to a maximum of 90%.

The first stack also increases the target's incoming Critical Multiplier by 0.1. Additional stacks increase this effect by 0.05 per stack, to a maximum of 0.5.

This increase is additive after mods, and applies before Critical Damage tier.

At 10 stacks, the target becomes Frozen (max 1 stack, 3 second duration). Frozen Crowd Controls enemies, prevents shield recharge, and increases target's incoming Critical Multiplier to 1.0.

### Electricity
**Corpus Amalgam 1.5x, The Murmur 1.5x**

Inflicts Tesla Chain (unlimited stacks, 6 second independent duration).

Tesla Chain Crowd Controls the target, and deals 3m AoE damage every second for 6 seconds. This is affected by Critical Damage, Stealth Bonuses, and Headshots.

Tesla Chain damage can hit Headshots, however its Headshot damage multiplier is 1x.

### Heat
**Infested 1.5x, Kuva Grineer 0.5x**

Inflicts Ignite (unlimited stacks, 6 second independent duration).

Ignite Crowd Controls enemies, reduces armour by up to 50% (exact numbers unknown) and deals damage every 6 seconds (first tick is delayed by 1 second).
