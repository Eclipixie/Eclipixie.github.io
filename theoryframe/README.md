# Idea

Theoryframe is meant to be a buildcrafting website, similarly to overframe.gg, but angled more towards newer players. This means that while it does discuss the *what* of a build, it is also meant to discuss the *why* and *how* of the build. Hopefully, at some point, it will also discuss what, why and how *to* build.

## Roadmap

### Long Term Goals

They'll be done when they're done - I don't want to give myself a hard deadline on this.

* Phase 1: Buildcrafting service - drag/drop mods, frame interchanging, etc.
    * Some components of this cannot be run by purely API just yet - apparently DE is planning on making a dedicated wiki rather than relying on Fandom, which will (hopefully) make it much easier to fill out static information.
* Phase 2: Build sharing - going to be run differently from overframe.gg or similar websites on account of lack of backend.
* Phase 3: Drop sources & warframe.market pricing - low priority at this stage.

### Short term goals

#### Phase 1

* Warframe API "integration"
    * Warframes
    * Mods
* Helminth abilities
* Guide on damage types and status effects
* Community notes on popular/presently relevant frames (newly released, starters/recommended early game, and cycling through as the meta changes)
* Build crafter
    * Frame swapper
    * Mods (ho boy this one's gonne be rough)
        * Polarities
        * Auras
        * Energy
        * Sets
    * Helminth ability swapper
    * Archon shards
* Build sharing and saving
    * Saving is reliant 100% on browser cookies b/c no backend (note to self: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp )
    * Sharing will be in a similar fashion to Destiny 2's DIM - builds will be shared with a boatload of GET data ( https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/ )

Community notes will be added in asynchronously
